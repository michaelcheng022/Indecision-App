## Indecision App

My first React application made to teach me some basic principles of React. This project is a todo list application that features a randomizer to help you make a decision of which item on your list you should do.

This project taught me the basics of webpack, how to structure a React application, and how to organize your stylesheets with SASS/LESS style sheet language.

## Features
* Fully responsive web page
* Add new todo item
* Delete todo item
* Randomizer button to choose todo item
